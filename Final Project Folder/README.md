Problem Statement a.k.a Decompose The Ask
How has Covid impacted crime statistics in select major metropolitan cities?

Identify Data Sources
We will be using open source files and exporting data from local city police departments historical data. Additionally, we will be using data NY Times GitHub location. 

Crime Data
•	Seattle
o	https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5

•	Denver
o	https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-crime

•	San Francisco
o	https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783

•	Los Angeles
o	https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8

•	Philadelphia

•	Washington DC

Corona Virus Case Data
•	NY Times GitHub for coronavirus data 
o	https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv

Define Strategy and Metrics

•	Is there a correlation in crimes and open Covid cases by major cities?
•	Change in crime over the last 18 months by type and by select city?
•	Are there more or less specific crimes committed? Any noticeable changes in the types of crimes committed? Violent vs non-violent? 

Description of Data Analysis Tools You Plan to Use
Describe the tools you plan to use throughout the project. As you might expect, there 
will be several stages in the project. Make sure to use at minimum the required tools 
(see Project1 power point).

•	Initially will use Excel and Pivot tables to help clean and sort the data files
•	Will create Jupyter Notebook and Pandas combine data from the two separate csv files:  
1.	Covid Case data
2.	Master Crime Data with selected cities combined
•	Panda data frames for initial data analysis and csv file merge
•	MatPlotLib for graphs and further statistical analysis 
•	PowerPoint to summarize and present findings

Describe the Data Products Your Project Will Produce
Data products include results of statistical tests, visualizations of the data, websites/apps,
or model parameters. What will be the tangible evidence of your discovered insights?

•	Used trend graphs for each select city to detect any noticeable patterns year-over-year.
•	Will see if there is a statistical correlation between open Covid case and change in # of crimes committed during that time period.
